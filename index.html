     <p>Over the years, I have learned several things about myself: the need for instructions to guide step by step with an assignment, the ability to coordinate with other members of a team on a unified effort to accomplish a goal, but most importantly the creativity to reach that particular goal. With computer science being the one area that fulfills that void in my life. Whether it is creating the most efficient pseudocode to aid me during the creation of a new program or puzzling over the unlimited options to code a particular algorithm, I am able to achieve the utmost satisfaction even before finding a desired solution. Avionics has tested my mental endurance to proceed with a project until I eventually arrived at the resolution. Majority of the time it was a team effort that enabled my peers and myself to ensure that a specific set of equipment met the standards of our technical publications that governed our craft. Some projects required little time to perfect while others were more strenuous with a great deal of complexity needed to resolve. Communicating properly among members of my work environment and personnel of different departments helped us to guarantee the successful operation of any avionics equipment that passed through our hands. Unfortunately, I could not see myself continuing avionics for the rest of my life because there was still a void yearning to be filled. That void being the addition of creativity that I secretly sought after that I could never find with avionics. Meanwhile, computer science offers the same level of complexity and team oriented projects, but with added creativity without sacrificing structure and organization. My primary focus is to land an opportunity to participate in an internship within the video gaming industry that will test my abilities to function inside a real-world scenario and retrieve guidance from more senior personnel.</p>
